# Open work

The tracking file. The owner asked twice for the navigation sweep and it was
lost twice between turns, so it lives here now rather than in a conversation.

**Rule: nothing is "done" until a human can reach it by clicking.** Building a
page, wiring its API and passing `check:all` proves the code exists. It does not
prove anybody can find it. Every bug the owner found on 2026-08-30 lived in that
gap.

## In flight

Nothing. Everything dispatched this session has landed and been verified here,
not on an agent's report.

## Reachability — swept 2026-08-30, and now guarded

Every page under `app/app` (97) and `app/platform` (24) is a sidebar row, a
named drill-in with a stated reason, or an explicit exclusion with one.
`scripts/check-nav-audit.mjs` fails the build if a new page slips through, in
either tree — so this cannot silently rot again.

Closed in this sweep:

- `/platform/voice-webhooks` — was linked ONLY from the phone-pool alert on
  `/platform`, so with no alert showing there was no way in. Now has a sidebar
  row.
- `/app/analytics/{digest,statements,win-loss,estimate-accuracy}` — kept as
  drill-ins off the Insights hub rather than four more rows, each with its
  inbound link named. Documented rather than silent, which was the actual
  complaint.
- An independent second pass re-verified every drill-in by grepping for the
  route literal rather than trusting the comment, and found no dead links and no
  stale entries.

## Waiting on the owner, not on me

- **Stripe live keys.** Order matters: create both live webhook endpoints first,
  then set all three env vars together, then have the 8 Connect-onboarded
  contractors re-onboard. Doing the key before the webhooks means live events
  arrive with no valid secret and are silently rejected. 11 test-mode
  subscriptions will need re-subscribing; no real money has moved.
- **Suspend/Reactivate on `/platform/companies/[id]`** — the only write path onto
  a customer's own Company row in the whole console. Either a sanctioned
  exception to non-negotiable #3 or a violation. A product call.
- **Photo retention.** Job photos are liability evidence (CompanyCam's own
  benchmark is 7-10 years for structural work) and the product never deletes
  data. Unbounded Cloudinary storage on a flat subscription is a margin problem.
  Needs a stated policy, including what happens on cancellation.

## Planned, not started

- Job-site photo documentation beyond intake: internal before/during/after
  timeline, annotation, photo reports. `JobPhoto`'s stated purpose in its own
  schema comment is still the public website gallery, not a liability record.
- Drag-to-reorder on the Leads board. The board, columns, cards and status
  endpoint all exist; only the drag interaction is missing. Use `@dnd-kit`
  (React 19), never `@hello-pangea/dnd`. A drop into "Converted" must go through
  the real conversion endpoint, which also creates a Quote — not a bare status
  PATCH.
- Plaid, when there are enough paying companies to amortise a $1,000+/month
  floor — roughly 100 connected accounts at break-even, comfortable at 200-300.
  CSV import is the deliberate stand-in and is built so Plaid is a backfill:
  every row records its source, and the duplicate key is source-blind.

## Deliberately not built

- Job-stage board. `JobStatus` is inferred from real events — visits starting,
  time entries closing. Dragging a card to "Completed" would flip the status
  without the facts underneath it and skip the review-request and payroll logic
  that depends on that transition happening for real.
- A native mobile app, and therefore CompanyCam's camera-first capture, GPS
  tagging and offline sync. Honest about it rather than shipping a web
  imitation.
