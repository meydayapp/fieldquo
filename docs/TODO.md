# Open work

The tracking file. The owner asked twice for the navigation sweep and it was
lost twice between turns, so it lives here now rather than in a conversation.

**Rule: nothing is "done" until a human can reach it by clicking.** Building a
page, wiring its API and passing `check:all` proves the code exists. It does not
prove anybody can find it. Every bug the owner found on 2026-08-30 lived in that
gap.

## In flight

| What | Where | State |
|---|---|---|
| Monthly digest reads the CONVERSATIONS behind won and lost quotes | `/app/analytics/digest` | agent building |

Owner-approved 2026-08-30: transcripts on both won and lost quotes, monthly
only, roughly $0.04–$0.10 per company per month on a cheap model.

**Deliberately NOT part of it**, and this should not be revisited without a
reason: no AI on `/app/analytics/win-loss`, `/app/analytics/estimate-accuracy`
or `/app/analytics/statements`. Both of those modules carry a written argument
against it — every sentence win-loss can honestly produce is a function of six
integers, and a model reading its free-text decline reasons would cluster them
into categories that are not really there; estimate-accuracy's named failure is
a model inventing a cause on numbers a contractor reprices against. The digest
is allowed AI because its findings are computed in code and the model only
phrases them.

The transcript work is the one thing those decisions do not cover: an objection
raised aloud, a budget mentioned and never written down, a competitor named —
evidence that exists only as prose, which code cannot read.

## Reachability — swept 2026-08-30, and now guarded

Every page under `app/app` (97) and `app/platform` (24) is a sidebar row, a
named drill-in with a stated reason, or an explicit exclusion with one.
`scripts/check-nav-audit.mjs` fails the build if a new page slips through, in
either tree — so this cannot silently rot again.

Closed in this sweep:

- `/platform/voice-webhooks` — was linked ONLY from the phone-pool alert on
  `/platform`, so with no alert showing there was no way in. Now has a sidebar
  row.
- `/app/analytics/{digest,statements,win-loss,estimate-accuracy}` — kept as
  drill-ins off the Insights hub rather than four more rows, each with its
  inbound link named. Documented rather than silent, which was the actual
  complaint.
- An independent second pass re-verified every drill-in by grepping for the
  route literal rather than trusting the comment, and found no dead links and no
  stale entries.

## Waiting on the owner, not on me

- **Stripe live keys.** Order matters: create both live webhook endpoints first,
  then set all three env vars together, then have the 8 Connect-onboarded
  contractors re-onboard. 11 test-mode subscriptions need re-subscribing; no
  real money has moved.
- **Suspend/Reactivate on `/platform/companies/[id]`** — the only write path onto
  a customer's own Company row in the console. Sanctioned exception to
  non-negotiable #3, or a violation. A product call.
- **A named privacy officer.** Quebec Law 25 requires the title and contact be
  PUBLISHED on the website once you hold a Quebec resident's data. By default the
  role falls to whoever holds highest authority. There is no such disclosure
  today.
- **Legal review** of anything drafted below before it is published.

## Legal and privacy — found 2026-08-30, ranked by exposure

The data-flow audit turned these up. Ranked worst first.

1. **CASL: no unsubscribe in any email.** `MarketingSubscriber.subscribed`
   exists and is honoured before sending, but toggling it needs `user:manage` —
   it is staff-only, and there is no public unsubscribe route anywhere.
   Canada's anti-spam law requires a working unsubscribe mechanism in commercial
   electronic messages. This is the sharpest legal exposure in the product.
2. **"Reply STOP" is promised with nothing behind it.** Appointment reminders
   tell homeowners to reply STOP. The only inbound SMS webhook is the crew line,
   matched on `CrewInboxNumber` — a homeowner's STOP is not processed by
   FieldQuo at all. It may be handled at the Twilio account level; that is not
   verifiable from the repo and must not be claimed until confirmed.
3. **No retention limit on call recordings or transcripts.** No cron, no expiry
   field, no deletion path. Combined with "nothing is ever deleted", a homeowner's
   recorded call is kept indefinitely.
4. **No company-deletion path exists at all** — not self-serve, not admin. A
   contractor asking to be deleted has no backend flow.
5. **No homeowner-facing data surface.** The client portal shows invoices only.
   No access, correction, export or deletion for the person whose name, address,
   photos and recorded call are held.
6. **Google Maps and Google Solar receive homeowner addresses** for roof
   measurement and address autocomplete — a live processor missing from
   AGENTS.md's stack table.
7. **Homeowner IP and user agent are stored** on `Quote.signature` and
   `ServicePlanAuthorisation`, with no retention path. IP is personal data in
   most frameworks.
8. **No data residency is established in code** for any processor. A policy
   naming a country would be inventing a fact.
9. **No cookie banner, no sub-processor list, no DPA** anywhere in the repo.

Fixed 2026-08-30: the receptionist now tells callers the call is recorded.

## Planned, not started
## Planned, not started

- Job-site photo documentation beyond intake: internal before/during/after
  timeline, annotation, photo reports. `JobPhoto`'s stated purpose in its own
  schema comment is still the public website gallery, not a liability record.
- Drag-to-reorder on the Leads board. The board, columns, cards and status
  endpoint all exist; only the drag interaction is missing. Use `@dnd-kit`
  (React 19), never `@hello-pangea/dnd`. A drop into "Converted" must go through
  the real conversion endpoint, which also creates a Quote — not a bare status
  PATCH.
- Plaid, when there are enough paying companies to amortise a $1,000+/month
  floor — roughly 100 connected accounts at break-even, comfortable at 200-300.
  CSV import is the deliberate stand-in and is built so Plaid is a backfill:
  every row records its source, and the duplicate key is source-blind.

## Deliberately not built

- Job-stage board. `JobStatus` is inferred from real events — visits starting,
  time entries closing. Dragging a card to "Completed" would flip the status
  without the facts underneath it and skip the review-request and payroll logic
  that depends on that transition happening for real.
- A native mobile app, and therefore CompanyCam's camera-first capture, GPS
  tagging and offline sync. Honest about it rather than shipping a web
  imitation.
